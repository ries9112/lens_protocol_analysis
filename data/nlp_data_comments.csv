5,203,"Tecate, one of the highest-selling beers on the Mexican market to date, is a delicious blend of malt and hops that contains only 4.6% alcohol, making it extremely easy to drink. 
The brand is named after the small city near Tijuana. 
Tecate, on the other hand, has a smooth and bitter taste. 
However, the sweet malt flavor is combined with a low hop bitterness to create a light and refreshing flavor. 
Tecate tastes the best.
I love it.. Corona. Sol. Buqui-bichi brewery has the banquetera which is a Kölsch type beer. Rare specimen in Mexico, also delicious. Probably it is @Pintatoken waiting for it's .lens handle, and MX landing.

5,382,"Have fun. Time is up. Me too. No way. He is my age. I'm full. Take it easy. I'm lost. not living in nations would be ideal, except for the fact that we have to start out living in nations, and in the absence of such stability IRL, some form of dark triad, ""barrel of the gun"" despotism.
I think the network state is meant to reinforce the design principle of ""creating smaller communities, making them somewhat permissionless, and sharing a social contract that define values and ideas"". Firstly, the atomicity implied with network unions. Having a clear limit on the lowest building block matches the smaller community constraint, relative to the larger whole. Secondly, the one commandment matches, if nothing else, the permissionless nature of any group to spontaneously form the atomic unit (and implied censorship-resistance between such units). The question about social contracts that define values and ideas is that they must be generalized if they are to be applied to many diverse groups, otherwise it is some centralized group that reinforces their own values and ideas at the cost of the larger population's freedom to do the same. I don't think that ""nations"" as used in this context mean some ""state"" or a centralized government covering a region. In fact, I would refer to the ""nations"" of native Americans as a good example of a group of people with a shared self-governance, values, and without the stipulation of private ownership or domination. To dissolve such an identity to promote a previously global identity seems contradictory.. ""I see more value by trying to fade away of the idea of thinking in living in nations and actually build more communities where people can relate with each other regardless of geographic locations.""

Isn't that exactly what a Network State would be?

I've been reading Jason Brennan's book, Against Democracy and beside his arguments for ""epistocracy,"" (rule of the well informed, which is definitely problematic to implement) it becomes clear that one of the biggest issues with living within a state defined by territory is the coercion from those making the rules. Whether the state is governed by democracy or epistocracy matters less than if the people who abide by its rules are united by their values.

If a single group consists of some people who believe we should live simple lives in a forest eschewing any industrial activity and some others who believe we should do everything we can to build habitats and live in space, there will be conflicts.

Currently, sovereign boundaries are still typically modified using military power. If new processes for drawing boundaries could be standardized that did not use military power, (just as cryptocurrency secures itself using mathematics instead of the militaries that support fiat currencies) we would be able to look at a much different world. Not easy though!. I’m reading Vitalik’s post and trying to find out how network states take care of their members that need help. Isn’t that one important task of a state? I did not find anything about it yet. Perhaps the network state vision, if it can attract enough attention, will encourage our current democratic governance mechanisms to be more equitable, transparent,... That alone would be a step forward.. Ok. The community will be regardless of geographical locations. But community members and community resources will still be located within different geographic nations, states in with their own ideas, police, armie, monopoly on violence, laws etc.

What to do when geographic nations begin to interfere in the life of online communities? Community members will be located in different states with different attitudes towards residents. What will we do when the values and ideas of the community come into confrontation with the nations? And geographic nations will decide to have an impact on the community.. Agreed! I think that communities that have always organized independently because their governments failed at including them will have the most potential, since their culture has been built around principles where the nature of this technology works best. #ETHMexico was an amazing example of the yet to be discovered potential in Latin American communities!!",14,700,15.1,-0.1,NA,NA,1460

5,486,"yes. You can make it. Never mind. I think it is a great idea. How would royalties work for marketplaces that intend to implement 0% royalty policies?. Royalties would be huge, it'd definitely encourage secondary sales. It'd also be cool if you could create a whitelist for a specific collect, and offer it as an exclusive freebie to current holders.. So a fixed fee vs a percent?. Just do it !. The simple possibility to collect royalties automatically on every secondary sale is already a killer feature

However, it's too early to describe the best way to set the fees imo. Maybe we'll see in 2-3 years to let everyone try as most formulas as possible. for musicians it feels like a really fair thing. Something that the re-sale of records was never capable to do.. do it!. Would be cool if it was built into the smart contract but I still feel like there are ways around it like wrapping the NFT.

How do you stop people from trading the NFT without paying the royalty fee?. Muhammad did not come to Muhammad⌛ Muhammad came to the top, so you have to show what we can and can therefore give and never 🌿 take away because it is our common good # web3 #crypto. do it. I think it's really awesome for artists who traditionally work job to job with no constant revenue stream. This allows them to have some semblance of economic security and allows them to monetize themselves better.. Best model will be on limited number of free mint + royalties : you win if your project/social network account live, not if you are a good marketer !. I think that royalties can be a huge benefit, that NFTs can bring to creators. It could be actually a ""competitive advantage"" of NFTs in the battle with other formats. 

But it is a pity that we haven't figured out how to make the royalties an inherent part of the NFT smart-contracts.  Isn't there really any way how to do that? I was trying to find something myself, but haven't managed it yet.. This could work well for long-form written content such as research papers, ebooks, and articles.. I see this happening a lot on Tezoz-based NFT marketplaces like obijkt and it's a huge success! Most artist's list things for pretty cheap, and they let the secondary market/royalties do the talking. As an artist, it's fun because you get to focus on making work while still having little stipends in between pieces - and as a collector, you get to own a lot more work while also showing more love to a broader array of artists in the space 👍. Great idea, I think it will also lead creators to making limited series collections and a whole secondary market of people trying to complete sets.

participated in hackathons both online/in-person and organized a few of them in college
- being able to ship code without overthinking
- opening keynote/speakers (i usually miss the other talks)
- meeting other hackers and listening to their backgrounds/experiences
- good sponsors with that have good dev experiences always make or break the projects that are built
- free food. 阿斯蒂芬. well done boy. devcon this year will be my first!. gm Stani!

We participated in the EThWarsaw hackathon (thanks for the advice with going gradient ;)

I like:
- meeting builders from around the world
- close contact with protocols & the big foundations
- the chance of finding your future co-founder (although translating a hackathon project into an actual business needs many things to consider, especially for team & founder dynamics)

Hope to see you at EthBerlin!. ok. good. GM! I've been participating in hackathons and hackfests for 6+ years now. 

What I like about them:

- The abundance of creative ideas
- The exponential learning curve which comes from attending them
- It is mind expanding, offers new perspectives which can be applied to work, hobbies, life.
- Who doesn't like lacking sleep with frens.
- The diversity of attendees.. gm stani

6,44,"I would love to have ""devices"" added so I could use from my mobile without having to add my wallet to my phone.. The bot problem, emoji integration in the comment menu, faster streaming of content and perhaps even mobile. But Lenster has already come a long way. Excited to see where this will all take us! ✨. When I tried to mint a piece of lens content into an NFT, the unlimited number of this NFT affected the mood of my mint and shrunk the value.. tackling the bot issue!. GM. it's not a feature rather a bug ;-) using @ is really challenging. The text field behaves really strange using @ in a (longer) text.. waaaa these bots go nuts in the comments section! Let's hope we can fix this. 
On the other note, just as simple hover above a profile pic. / name to briefly explore the profile - maybe cast a follow could prevent from not remembering the feed scroll position as described by @punkess.lens 🤘. good!. I don't know, please advise. Curate lists! just like lens friends!. I can't help it. Don't worry. Could you do me a favor. Excuse me,Sir. I can't help it. I'm home. He is my age. I'm in a hurry. It's up to you. I'm single. That's neat. Believe it or not. I doubt it. I have no idea. So do I. You did right. Help yourself. You set me up. I'm lost. What a pity. Good luck. Hold on. Never mind. Increase file size limit from 100MB, so can upload Hi Res Audio WAV's & Artwork files.. thanks all some amazing feedback !!. Reaching for greater feature parity with twitter would be good. Blocking and muting will become important as the breadth of content grows, even if that just handled locally in the web app for the time being. Additionally improvements in how the text field for posting/commenting works is gonna become important, right now scroll back doesn't work and editing can get very weird when nesting @ names inside of urls. All of that said Lenster is an amazing product and I don't want to just cast stones when the app has already come so far.. Nice. connect a second (maybe HW wallet) to my profile. Edit button... 😉🫢. unmirror function? not possible?. Nothing. nice. nice. content discovery. Not saying you have to fill my feed with posts from people I'm not following or hot takes (twitter....🙄), but maybe the explore section can have more options to find new people to follow and interesting posts. I would very much like for the notification ⚡️ to stop lighting up red every time I reload the page.

- I'd change the name of transferOwnership for something like initOwnershipTransfer. To be clear that ""its a process"" and no just a one time action. Maybe you want to keep ""transferOwnership"" for some compatibility matters, in that case its ok.
- Instead of a double confirmation, I'd keep the new owner confirmation but I'd add a ""revertTimeOut"" parameter or something like that. In this way, the previous owner doesn't need to confirmate again but still has a chance to revert it if something went wrong.",9,175,7.1,0.2,NA,NA,1460

I would also recommend a vegan protein shake with almond milk throughout the day.. Not for this photo bc looks very healthy.

My recommendations earlier today were all ok (strong profiles with low noise i.e. v low post count) but now I'm back to seeing same top 5 as this time yesterday (https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x242d-0xdf).. This is my new account, so I'll be interested to see how the algo shapes up.. thanks，we need a way to make other konw and follow us. Great to see this! 

Quick reaction to my first five recommended profiles:
3 are a very hard ""no"" - pics of dogs or other (weak profile stats: following 10k & tiny number followers)
2 are a ""maybe"" - have potentially interesting content (strong profile stats: following 200 & 1-2k followers)",15,197,6.4,0.3,"/Arts & Entertainment",0.61,1460

Eventually (possibly in 12 years!) the BTC block reward won't be enough to cover the cost of mining, and miners will have to rely on transaction fees, but Bitcoin doesn't generate alot of fees because the BTC token has no utility. You just buy and hold. It's highly likely the transaction fees also won't cover the cost of mining. People will stop mining and the networks security will be abysmal.

**What excites you in ZKP space (on any timescale)?**

I am personally stoked for Namada to launch its mainnet, and for the Brave and True the testnet is there! As the first fractal instance of Anoma, it could begin the 'undefining money' vision of intent matching through a gossip consensus, and will pave the way for any future fractal instance to come.

The MASP that will bridge private ERC-20 into anywhere in #IBC (Cosmos, as of quite recently, XCVM Composable Finance parachain, NEAR etc) is the exciting bit as far as ZKP goes.

I'll try to be more present though if it seems as though there's legitimate interest beyond the potential for an airdrop. (spoiler alert; there's been a couple, but none here as of yet). 

The $DOWN DAO is an extension of my social token project that I launched as an alternative to restarting my token that was issued 2 years ago via Roll; when they got hacked last March, the response (well, the lack of one really) wasn't exactly filling a confidence builder, so I decided that I could very likely manage just fine without a company that did little besides put some infrastructure in place and keep 10% of everyone's issued social currencies in a hot wallet that was exploited for about $15mil. 

The $DOWN whitepaper is here - https://mirror.xyz/0x1BeABFaCac17a3E223D3371AbB35Ed396186CadD/EYS47w86LM4KY9lhb1NY21dqpAVxzrBzL4NAAsF_OYk. Help yourself. Guys, what's popping. Anyone follows me and I will follow u back.. 我不认为区块链是黑暗森林，我感觉是童话故事. 诚信互关，最好留言方便回关

10788,19,"Thanks a lot for the response, Stani! Actually, it sounds like quite a simple and pretty smart solution. The only struggle is that it requires creating a lot of app on top of one protocol. But apparently that is something which goes quite well already too, for which I am really glad. 

Btw, the LensTube is awesome! The UI is quite as convenient as the one of YouTube and there are already some great content creators as well. It will be probably my next favourite DeSocial app. :) 

But one more question about the portable data. Is there any way how the users can take their data from Lens to another decentralised social platform, which isn't on the Lens protocol?. The way it works is that you create your profile once and attach a handle and after that you can use any application that uses Lens with your profile (no need to create a new one).

You can experience it by going to lenstube.xyz and signing in with your profile, i.e. you don't need to create another profile. Also the apps can actually decide what to curate, so for example LensTube shows only content from LensTube, but Lenster shows everything including LensTube videos.",2,206,7.1,0.4,NA,NA,1460
10788,21,"Awesome, I knew that there has to be possible to implement it into the contract. Would be such a smart-contract less optimized and so more expensive for minting or is there any other trade-off because of that we don't normally use it? 

But anyway, I agree that the Lens community is one of those that can definitely put it forward. If there is someone who is currently working on something like that I would be glad if I can help. I am not a dev but I work as a project and marketing strategist so I can put some ideas from that level.. Yes, it's incredible that we can actually bring more monetization tolls and income streams to creators and that brings more excitement around NFTs but also gives more ability for the creators to create more especially in the early stage of their careers. Whether the royalties should be indefined period, for that I am not sure yet.

Its actually quite possible to do @klaudy.lens on smart contract level its more about the NFT community coming together and supporting the standard across the platforms. I think Lens community could be one of those communities that could lead with an example.",2,206,5,0.3,NA,NA,1460
10788,23,"Would not be significant differences on the optimizations or minting costs, you could even have such contract as a standard NFT contract and even the fees set to 0. It's more about the marketplaces respecting the royalties especially if the trading happens on centralized exchanges. Also its more about general acceptance to avoid folks wrapping the NFTs to another smart contract to avoid the fees.

Yes if anyone is interested on working on this would be epic to explore.",1,80,1.6,0,"/Finance",0.54,1460

Storj is an Ethereum-based distributed cloud storage protocol developed by the for-profit company Stroj Labs. Users can use their platform token $STORJ to purchase storage services on the Storj platform, which is similar to Airbnb and Uber. Users use idle storage space to provide storage services and get $STORJ in return. Compared with centralized cloud storage services, Storj's distributed cloud storage can provide users with higher security and privacy, and provide cheaper prices by utilizing idle storage resources.. 123.

The premise of 'Web 3.0' was coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood shortly after Ethereum launched in 2014. Gavin put into words a solution for a problem that many early crypto adopters felt: the Web required too much trust. That is, most of the Web that people know and use today relies on trusting a handful of private companies to act in the public's best interests.. I want to have a good meal tonight... here we go. gm.

https://open.spotify.com/album/5oSVYKZLKGCmwYqmJ7AZnO?si=-MaMt_EXTleNpFJ-QRS5SA. Dinosaur by King Crimson is such an odd song. The intro harmonies are odd, the minor 3rd rift is odd, especially when it's a Bb - G playing over a G major chord. The wee Eb major, E minor, F major harmonic move to the bridge is something I think you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere else 😅, and the lyrics are great! It's about the singer (Adrian Belew, guitarist for other artist such as David Bowie, Talking Heads etc etc) reflecting on his life, especially his body of work (""I'm a dinosaur. Somebody is digging my bones""), and the life lessons he's learned along the way (""It doesn't pay to be too nice. It's the one thing I have learned.""). It's a great song, but very under appreciated.

13905,39,"How Do NFTs Work?

NFTs are marketed and distributed through online marketplaces such as Rarity.tools or NFTcatcher.io. Investors can look through an inventory of assets before choosing one to buy. One must have cryptocurrency to buy the digital asset and create an account on the NFT marketplace that is connected to the cryptocurrency wallet holding the coins.

The most common blockchain NFTs use Ethereum ERC-20 tokens. The ERC-20 token is what the blockchain uses to issue a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens can also be purchased with Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot cryptocurrency.

NFTs have opened up a new door for artists, companies, and celebrities to monetize their assets. Artists are able to create a library of digital assets to market to a new wave of investors and collectors. Celebrities are creating assets that capitalized on their celebrity brand identity. Some NFTs are selling for thousands, even millions of dollars.

How Are NFTs Different from Cryptocurrency?

NFTs are not the same as cryptocurrency. An NFT uses cryptocurrency to conduct the transaction. It uses the same blockchain technology that cryptocurrency uses but the asset is set up differently. Whereas a cryptocurrency coin can be traded or exchanged at equivalency, the NFT cannot. This is because each cryptographic asset is set up with a unique identification code and metadata that distinguishes one NFT from another. In other words, you can trade one Bitcoin for another Bitcoin–they are equal–but NFTs don’t trade equally.",1,248,5.2,0,"/Finance/Investing/Currencies & Foreign Exchange",0.9,1460

We’re also one of the only marketplaces that supports EIP-2981 on-chain royalties. You set, we support. Trustless.

We also hated that royalties were often custodied for weeks at a time, so we made sure that royalties earned on LooksRare were paid out instantly in each tx.

It’s not our place to say who deserves royalties or how much, but if you want artists and creators to be able to go all out, do cool shit and give back, they probably need your support.. We’re going to be switching up LooksRare’s site preview image and we’d love to include some of your NFTs!

14562,50,"These smart contracts have some unique properties:

zkApps preserve users’ privacy. They use cryptography to prove that something is factual without revealing context or extra information around said fact. So this means zkApps end users can interact using proofs of their personal data, instead of sharing the data itself. For example, zkApps can connect to a credit score provider to prove that your credit score is above a certain threshold. Soon, you’ll be able to prove so much more from any website. This ensures a private and secure experience for the user, and there is also no burden on developers to host and safeguard their users’ sensitive data.

zkApps can execute unlimited off-chain computations at a flat fee. Other blockchains typically use a variable gas fee-based model that is dependent on supply and demand of the network at any given moment. zkApps, in contrast, can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off-chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation.

zkApps can connect Web2 to Web3. Currently, other blockchains cannot easily bring information that’s on the internet on-chain, limiting the utility of blockchain applications. zkApps, however, can privately interact with any website, proving facts about APIs and webpages on the internet, and access verified real world data for use on-chain. This capability is possible through zkOracles, which uses HTTPS to connect real world data to blockchain in the most trustless way possible.

zkApps can be accessed from other chains and devices – Thanks to Mina’s succinct design, Mina’s zero knowledge proof (ZKP) programmability can be accessed from other chains and ultimately even end user devices like smartphones. For instance, there is a bridge being established between Mina and Ethereum so that any dapps built on Ethereum could also leverage Mina’s privacy and other benefits. This feature is enabled by zkBridge technology, which will be available to connect Mina with any other chain.

zkApps are written in Typescript. Instead of being written in a new programming language that developers have to learn, zkApps are programmed using SnarkyJS, which is a Typescript-based library. This greatly expands the pool of developers who can easily get started building zkApps.",1,376,7.2,0,"/Computers & Electronics/Programming",0.96,1460

8 月 3 日消息，Ava Labs 创始人 Emin Gün Sirer 在社交媒体表示，目前在针对 Solana 生态系统的持续攻击中，已经有 7000 多个钱包受到影响，并且正在以 20/min 的速度增长。他认为，因为现在还很早，而且攻击仍在进行中，所以有很多错误信息和猜测。 
他说，由于交易签名正确，攻击者很可能已经获得了对私钥的访问权限。一种可能的途径是供应链攻击，其中 JS 库被黑客入侵，并泄露（窃取）用户的私钥。目前停止链条是无济于事的，当链条恢复时攻击将恢复。”",1,42,0.1,0,NA,NA,1460

万众瞩目的奥德赛将在美东时间6/21 下午1点开始，大家准备好了吗？

第一周为跨链桥周，可以从官方公布的10多个项目中选择跨eth到arbitrum，需要注意几点：

1.金额无限制；
2.必须跨eth;
3.从哪条链跨无限制；
4.跨链周结束后使用过任意跨链桥的用户将得到一个nft;
5.使用了累计eth最多的跨链桥的用户讲额外得到一个nft.

从目前的热度来看：
几个比较能打的跨链桥介绍如下：
1.bungee:目前这个跨链桥未发币，在twitter上和社区的热度较高，8848基本选定这个跨链；
2.multi：这个已经发币，但在活动期间免手续费，应该也会有比较高的人气；
3.li.fin： 跨链聚合，未发币，也属于人气项目，不容忽视；
4.connext：已快照，未发币。比较能打，但感觉不会第一；
5.hashflow：新进入的跨链swap，已发币，费用比较高；
6.官方桥：费用便宜，从opti的空投上来看，官方跨链是必须的，所以建议来一波。

策略：
推荐：官方桥/multi/bungee/li.fin  我感觉基本上就这几个了。
号不多的可以先选择官方桥，然后后半周再看情况来补刀。
好多的，我觉得官方桥/multi/bungee先上吧。. 【奥德赛】第一周桥交互策略

22630,1597,"hm, isn't this all possible? an NFT contains a pointer to a URL of a digital asset. the asset could be an image, a video, a PDF, basically any digital file. and you could include several URLs.

I better provide an example. this NFT is an image, but also an animation:
https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x7ee2c4a5cab5b0d6fdf4c55177b0a8bf99054485/8
if you click on the token ID (under Details), you are routed to this IPFS URL with all the metadata:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQRJXgPtfB6DAz9RYnSPJyncPjwyQCEpnAQNDjA4RGDE9
near the end, there are two additional URLs: one for the image and one for the animation. you can copy and open them in the browser. they lead to the original files which you can download.

so, for a music NFT I would imagine that you could include the music file, a cover image, a PDF with lyrics,... I haven't seen this yet, but it should be possible. I guess, people at Manifold, Zora, Glass,... could provide help here for setting up a smart contract which includes those URLs.",1,174,1.2,0,"/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music",0.6,1460

25144,26,"Lens之外的投资机会：
最近市场上粉丝代币太火了，很多人通过微信来问我可以买什么，我告诉他的是粉丝代币在世界杯开始前还能炒作好几波儿，但是不是普涨的行情，熊市背景下市场上的资金有限，只能轮番上涨，其实在6月份左右的时候我就在推特上提醒过可以提前买入粉丝代币；
要是想赌，最直接的途径是买入币安上的粉丝代币，挑没有大涨过的买，要是求稳就买粉丝代币的爸爸$CHZ，在$CHZ面前$SOC和$WICC这些都是弟弟，只是因为他们的盘子比较小，洗盘时间较长，容易让庄家操作而已；
除了上面这些，其实还有一种代币可以买，那就是预测类代币（注意了，预测类代币不是预言机），说白了就是专注于博彩的平台类代币，这一类代币也有很多，但是都还没有上涨，算是一个弯道超车的机会，我以前关注的一个代币是$POLK，这个太小众了，还有很多比较大的预测类代币和平台，多找找，一定能赚钱。
其实我非常希望粉丝类的代币和平台能和Lens这样的去中心化社交图谱和应用深度结合，那一定非常有意思，下期就聊一下Lens去中心化社交和粉丝代币结合的展望。. 首个Talk-to-earn项目PLUR

Dumb Money

Just when we thought we had finally reached the bottom of the bear market, just when we thought liquidity had completely dried up, just when we thought we had returned to fundamentals and people had stopped pouring money into questionable projects, the news broke that Web2 app Sweatcoin has raised 13 million dollars to make the leap to Web3.

And it sure did break the news. GMN’s Publisher is hopping mad: “Traditionally, in legacy markets, the ‘smart money’ is considered to be the institutional investors such as the hedge funds of Wall Street and the ‘dumb money’ refers to retail investors like you and I. In the crypto industry, it would seem that these roles are reversed. We often see the ‘smart money’ buying the most ridiculous assets imaginable, such as WorldCoin and Cardano; Sweatcoin is the latest of those ‘brilliant’ ideas.”

According to Publisher, with billions of dollars in capital flowing into the latest shiny object (or in this case, sweaty object), it doesn’t leave much funding for projects and teams that are building products with real world application and potential to truly revolutionize antiquated industries. Move-to-earn apps like Sweatcoin are hot property lately, offering rewards for daily steps, movement challenges, and NFTs that grant perks and discounts. But are they just a hot take, looking to jump on the latest trend? 

People from around the world are slowly beginning to realize the importance of what is happening within the Ethereum ecosystem. While Web2 giants such as Sweatcoin decide to pivot to cash in on their existing users, brand new technology is being deployed every day on this network. Savvy blockchain developers are the ones putting in the blood, sweat, and tears to permissionlessly route around institutional roadblocks, to deploy software that can never be censored, and to develop applications that change lives. They’re the ‘boots on the ground’ who prove every day where the ‘smart money’ really is.. Good Morning News

You're welcome. hello. sudoswap 0版税的一点看法：
单体作品如beeple和一般collection NFT完全是两个市场，艺术家可以对单体作品设置版税收入，但是Collection作品应该0版税，创作者可以预留部分作品作为储备收入类似股权；
已发布的Collection作品的版权归根结底是Opensea的营销策略，这明显是最WEB2的做法而不是WEB3；
创作者要么自己开发新的协议层的NFT版税（只要转移就收税，旧的Collection还能Wrap过去），否则只能寄希望于所有用户继续留在Opensea交易；
sudo的AMM算法本质上是做了利益再分配，创作者版权税收转为用户的手续费收入，拿惯了Opensea分红的“老艺术家们”看到自己躺赚的收入没了难免没有情绪；
Collection类NFT更像股权机制，没听说过卖出去的股权在二级市场交易还要给创始人交税，相对来说给二级市场做市商手续费更合理，与Defi类似；
归根结底现在的Collection-NFT由卖方市场向买方市场转变，市场上不需要那么多新的PFP，而需要活跃的市场和真正的创新；. hi guys. 诚信互关，最好留言方便回关

The name Galatasaray itself comes from that of Galatasaray High School, which in turn takes its name from Galata Sarayı Enderûn-u Hümâyûn (Galata Palace Imperial School), the name of the original school founded on the site in 1481, and which in turn took its name from the nearby medieval Genoese citadel of Galata (the modern quarter of Karaköy) in the Beyoğlu (Pera) district of Istanbul.

In that match, Galatasaray won 2–0 over a local Greek club, and the spectators called them ""Galata Sarayı efendileri"" (English: ""Gentlemen of Galata Palace""), and, after this incident, they adopted that name and started to call their club ""Galata Sarayı"". In 1905, during the era of the Ottoman Empire, there were no laws for associations so the club could not be registered officially, but, after the 1912 Law of Association, the club registered legally.[19]

Since there weren't any other Turkish teams, Galatasaray joined the Istanbul League that was consisting of English and Greek teams in the season of 1905–1906.

Galatasaray (Turkish pronunciation: [ɡalatasaˈɾaj]) is a quarter in Karaköy in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, located at the northern shore of the Golden Horn. Its name comes from that of Galata, which may in turn have derived from Galatai (meaning the ""Galatians""), as the Celtic tribes were thought to have camped at Galata during the Hellenistic period before settling in Galatia in central Anatolia. Galatasaray translates directly as ""Galata Palace"" (saray means ""palace"" in Persian). Galatasaray High School, established in the area in 1481, was the progenitor of Galatasaray S.K. as well as other institutions of Galatasaray Community.[38]

Galatasaray is a compound word and is pronounced as such, with a very brief pause between the two words.[39] There is no diminutive form of the club's name. Fans refer to the club either by its full name or by its nickname Cim-Bom(-Bom), pronounced: [dʒim bom (bom)])—of uncertain etymology.

""The big three"" clubs of Istanbul – Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray – have a century-long history of rivalry. The Galatasaray–Fenerbahçe rivalry is the primary Istanbul derby and the most important rivalry in Turkish football.[60] The rivalry poses a symbolic importance to supporters due to an assumed superiority that comes with winning the derby. Supporters are often quoted as stating that winning the league without winning the derby is hollow. There is always huge interest in the derby due to its fierce nature on and off the pitch. Many documentaries have been made about the derby including an episode of The Real Football Factories International. The rivalry has led to violence among supporters on numerous occasions, though this has been on the decline in recent years. The typical features of derby days include sell out stadiums, loud support throughout the match and taunting choreography displays by supporters before kick off.[61] Other top level İstanbul derbies include the teams; İstanbul BB and Kasımpaşa although these teams pose a minor rivalry as the history and the nationwide attention to the derbies among the big three is unmatched.

The pair found that ocean temperatures in East Antarctica have risen by up to 2 ℃ since the early twentieth century, and the trend is accelerating. The rate of ocean warming in the region has tripled since the 1990s, they found, with the strongest warming occurring over the East Antarctic continental slope — near the glaciers whose protruding ice shelves have thinned or retreated most rapidly.

Guy Crescent (pictured), Pierre-Étienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle founded PSG in 1970.
In the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital.[1][2] Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2.[1][2][3] However, the three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu.[4][5] He told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team.20,000 people backed the project and Paris Saint-Germain were formed on June 17, 1970.[4] Guyot was elected the club's first president a few days later.[1][6][7] For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a club.[8] The merger was made official following the creation of the club's association on August 12, 1970.[6] PSG retains this day as their foundation date.[1]

Paris FC contributed with the financial backing, while Stade Saint-Germain provided the sporting infrastructure, from the Division 2 status to the Camp des Loges training center, as well as the manager Pierre Phelipon and most of the players, including Bernard Guignedoux, Michel Prost and Camille Choquier.[9] PSG further strengthened their squad with the signing of Jean Djorkaeff, captain of the French national team.[10] PSG's first official game was a 1–1 league draw away to Poitiers on August 23, 1970. Guignedoux scored the club's first ever goal from a free-kick.[11] The club went on to clinch promotion to Division 1 and claim the Division 2 title in its inaugural season.[2][12]

PSG's first top-flight season ended with a safe 16th place, meaning they would stay in Division 1 next year, but behind the scenes the club was in a delicate financial situation.[9][13] Back in September 1971, the Paris City Council offered 850k francs to pay the club's debt and save its place in the elite, demanding PSG in return to adopt the more Parisian name ""Paris Football Club.""[9][14] Guy Crescent, who had replaced Pierre-Étienne Guyot as club president before the start of the season, was in favor of the name change, but Henri Patrelle was against it.[3][15] The disagreement led to Crescent's resignation in December 1971, handing the presidency to Patrelle.[14] The latter tried to persuade the council to reconsider their position, but they remained inflexible and the club split on June 1, 1972, a few days after the last match of the campaign.[9][14][16] Backed by the council, Crescent re-formed Paris FC and remained in Division 1, while the PSG of Patrelle were administratively relegated to Division 3, thus losing professional status.[3][9][10]",1,517,1,0.1,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.64,1460

Fresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla, Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree.[52] But with star player Zlatan Ibrahimović gone, the club endured a disappointing 2016–17 season.[62][63] Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco, missing out on top spot for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, in the UEFA Champions League, the club suffered several disappointing nights,[56] including arguably the club's most painful continental defeat in the infamous and controversial ""La Remontada"" (""The Comeback"") against Barcelona, losing 6–1 in the second leg of the round of sixteen, despite winning the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[64]

During the 2021 summer transfer season, PSG completed one of the most historic transfer windows in football history, exercising the option to buy Danilo Pereira and signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan for a reported fee of €60 million. In addition, the club registered the free transfers of Netherlands captain Georginio Wijnaldum, Real Madrid and Spain Sergio Ramos and Euro 2020's player of the tournament Gianluigi Donnarumma.[82][83][84] PSG concluded their transfer window with the signing of one of the greatest players of all time and record Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, who unexpectedly left Barcelona following the expiration of his contract, and promising defender Nuno Mendes on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2022 in a transfer worth €38 million.[85][86] Later in the season, PSG went on to reclaim the Ligue 1 title for the record 10th time,[87] but fell short in the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid in the round of 16, a tie amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Kylian Mbappé's future.[88] However, on 21 May 2022, Mbappé extended his contract with PSG until 2025,[89] despite speculations of a possible transfer to Real Madrid,[90] which prompted La Liga officials to file a complaint to UEFA regarding accumulating losses of PSG in the previous years.[91]

Unsatisfied with the club direction and lack of European success club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi promised mega-changes heading into next season and stated the team will not win the UEFA Champions League as currently constructed. This was in an interview with Le Parisien.[92] Changes were needed at the club on a very deep level and as such during the pre season for the 2022-23 season the club embarked on an ambitious rebuild. The focus was to be Paris, France and Europe. This began with the hiring of transfer market expert Luis Campos who made his name at Monaco first and then Lille. Campos made his name as sporting director at Monaco from 2013 to 2016. He oversaw the transfers of Radamel Falcao, João Moutinho, James Rodríguez, Fabinho, Anthony Martial, Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar amongst others. A change in club ethos was noted and this was followed by the sacking of first team coach Pochetino[93] while an announcement for the hiring of Gatlier was made in quick succession.[94] A busy pre-season followed with a new transfer policy of ""No bling-bling"", the club quickly signed Nuno Mendes, Vitinha, Ekitike and Mukiele.

Likewise, PSG's most iconic shirts have been predominantly red, blue or white, with the remaining two colours included as well.[99] The club's official mascot, Germain the Lynx, also sports PSG's traditional colours.[97] It was unveiled during the 2010 Tournoi de Paris in commemoration of the club's 40th anniversary, and can be seen entertaining kids in the stands of the Parc des Princes or near the pitch with the players during the warm-up.[100]",1,250,1.2,0.2,"/Sports/Team Sports",0.58,1460

""Allez Paris!,"" recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971, was the club's first official anthem. A PSG fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the club's foundation in 1970.[101][102] The club's second anthem, ""Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!"" by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy's version. An initiative of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label.[103][104][105] The song's chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games.[106] A new version, also called ""Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!,"" was recorded in 2010 as part of the club's 40th anniversary celebrations. Sung to the tune of ""Go West"" by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans. This is the club's current official anthem.[97][100][104]

""Ô Ville Lumière"" (""Oh City of Light""), to the tune of ""Flower of Scotland,"" is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters.[107][108] Other notable chants from supporters' groups in the Boulogne and Auteuil stands include ""Le Parc est à nous"" (""The Parc is ours""), ""Ici, c'est Paris!"" (""This is Paris!""), and ""Paris est magique!"" (""Paris is magical!"").[97][109] Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s.[106][110][111] ""Ici, c'est Paris!"" and ""Paris est magique!"" are also the club's most iconic mottos.[97][112][113] ""Who Said I Would"" by Phill Collins is also a traditional anthem for the fans.

Wikimedia Commons has media related to Paris Saint-Germain FC kits.
During their first three seasons of existence, the home shirt of Paris Saint-Germain was red with blue and white details in its sleeves and neck to bring together the three colours of the club: the red and blue of Paris, and the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[99][115] During the 2010–11 season, PSG wore a red shirt during home matches to commemorate their 40th anniversary.[116]

The connection between Paris Saint-Germain and the city's fashion houses is a longstanding one. French fashion designer Daniel Hechter became PSG president in 1973 and designed the club's traditional home look that same year: a blue shirt with a red vertical stripe flanked by two thinner white stripes (blue-white-red-white-blue).[115][117] First worn in the 1973–74 season, the so-called ""Hechter shirt"" has remained the classic home identity of PSG ever since.[99][118][119][120]

The famous jersey made its debut during a home Ligue 2 game against Red Star on November 10, 1973.[121] This was also the club's maiden match at the Parc des Princes. PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club's first goal at the stadium as well as the first with the Hechter shirt.[21] PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s like Raí, Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with this kit. While wearing it, the capital club reached five European semi-finals in a row between 1993 and 1997, claimed the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and achieved eight consecutive wins against Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille between 2002 and 2004.[99][122]

The general belief is that Hechter based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax, the dominant team in Europe at the time, but with the French flag in mind.[13][115][117] Hechter himself has denied this, though, instead claiming he was inspired by the Ford Mustang. He transposed the car's hood stripes on the shirt and employed the three colours of the club.[115] The Hechter shirt has two alternate versions: the ""reversed Hechter"" (red-white-blue-white-red), introduced in the 1974–75 season, and the ""white Hechter"" (white-blue-red-blue-white), which premiered in the 1994–95 season.[115][120][123]

It was with the club's most iconic away outfit, though, that fans saw the first big PSG team which won their maiden Coupe de France titles in 1982 and 1983, experienced their first European campaign in 1983 and claimed their maiden league crown in 1986. The shirt was white with blue and red vertical stripes on the left.[99][118] Like the Hechter jersey, it debuted in the 1973–74 season as the away kit.[115] Promoted by PSG president Francis Borelli, the white shirt was the club's home identity from 1981 to 1990.[118] Now known as the ""Borelli shirt,"" it is synonym with PSG legends from the 1980s like Safet Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay.[99][119][124]",1,541,4.7,0.2,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.76,1460

The club's first crest was basically the same as the original Paris FC (PFC) logo. Having to merge and give birth to PSG using Stade Saint-Germain's stadium, the PFC crest kept its original design but the name below it changed from ""Paris FC"" to ""Paris Saint-Germain Football Club."" This badge consisted of a blue football with a red vessel inside it. The latter is a historic symbol of Paris and is present in the city's coat of arms. The name of the club was written below in red.[125]

Club crest between 1992 and 1995.
PSG, however, split from PFC in 1972 and thus needed a new crest. Representing both Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the club's second crest became the basis of the one the fans know today. The round logo featured the Eiffel Tower in red against a blue background and, underneath it, two Saint-Germain symbols in white: a fleur de lys and Louis XIV's cradle.[125] Created by Christian Lentretien, former PSG board member and publicist by profession, this crest was first used in 1972 and lasted until 1982.[125][126] The Parc des Princes, the club's home stadium, appeared below it between 1982 and 1990.[125]

The stadium was dropped from the crest in 1990. Two years later, then club owners Canal+ radically changed it in 1992. The new model had the acronym ""PSG"" in white against a blue-white-red-white-blue background (like the colour pattern of the Hechter shirt) with ""Paris Saint-Germain"" underneath in white against a black background. Under pressure from supporters, the traditional crest returned in 1995 with ""Paris Saint-Germain"" above the tower and ""1970"" below the cradle. This logo went through a slight facelift in 2002, most notably featuring a darker shade of blue.[125]

At the request of the club's Qatari owners, the traditional crest underwent a major makeover in 2013.[125] “Paris” is now written in big white bold letters above a large Eiffel Tower, clearly putting forward the brand “Paris” instead of “Paris Saint-Germain.” Underneath it, “Saint-Germain” is written in smaller letters below the fleur de lys.[112][127] The cradle and the club's founding year ""1970"" were left out.[127] PSG deputy general manager Jean-Claude Blanc said: “We are called Paris Saint-Germain but, above all, we are called Paris.”[112]",1,413,2.8,0,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.78,1460

41487,64,"9. Find hashtags that convert
One of the most tried-and-true ways to get followers on Instagram is through hashtags. For years hashtags have served as an essential tool for discovery and allowed us to extend our social reach. As a marketer, you want to build your community by gaining followers and hashtags provide just that.

For starters, find hashtags that are not too populated. Social Media Examiner points this theory out by explaining how the hashtag #love has more than 184 million photos connected to it. Trying to highlight your Instagram content in a sea of millions of pictures and videos is not an easy thing to do.

You have to find hashtags that people in your target audience are more likely to check. If a relevant connection is made, these users will be more likely to follow your account. Unique, branded hashtags are one way to group posts around hyper-relevant content to your brand and campaigns.

For example, M&Ms does a great job at focusing hashtags to an event where they are participating. By using hashtags like #mmspotlight, the brand targets its audience more directly where the spotlight concert event happens and creates awareness.

Understanding how your hashtags perform on Instagram is also just as critical to using them. And with Sprout Social’s hashtag analytics tools, you have direct access to hashtag performance and usage data to see what’s working best.",1,238,6.4,0.2,"/Internet & Telecom",0.73,1460

Last but not least, when you make your Instagram followers happy, you see the payoff in audience growth. We’ve given you plenty of tips for brainstorming and scheduling content, so put them into practice in a way that feels real to your brand voice. In other words, avoid seeming needy, sales-driven or robotic.

For many accounts, this means sprinkling in posts that are legitimately designed to bring a smile to followers’ faces and build customer relationships. Don’t forget to provide content to your followers as if they were friends on your personal feed: this might include posting memes, inspirational content, or just re-sharing interesting photos or artwork (all properly credited, of course) that can give your followers a little mental pick-up during the day.",1,135,1.9,0.3,"/Online Communities/Social Networks",0.68,1460
41500,51,"From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1979–1998)
The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed FC Breitnigge, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.[27]

Jupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion. Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[28]

His successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.[29] During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood.[30] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[31]",1,341,2.8,0,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.98,1460
41500,56,"Flick era (2019–2021)
Hansi Flick joined Bayern Munich on 1 July 2019 as an assistant coach.[60] Under Kovač, Bayern was off to a slow start in the league and after a 5–1 loss to Frankfurt, Kovač and Bayern parted ways on 3 November 2019 with Flick being promoted to interim manager.[61][62] After a satisfying spell as interim coach, Bayern announced on 22 December 2019 that Flick would remain in charge until the end of season.[63] Bayern's performances on the pitch picked up noticeably and in April 2020, the club agreed with Flick to a new permanent contract through 2023.[64] Under Flick the club won the league, having played the most successful leg of a Bundesliga season in history, and went on to claim the cup, thus completing the club's 13th domestic double. In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, en route beating FC Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals[65] and Lyon 3–0 in the semi-final. In the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the severity of COVID-19 pandemic, they defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match.[66] With the victory, they became the second European club to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons, matching the 2014–15 FC Barcelona team.[67]

After a short break, Bayern started the new season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. In a closely contested match, Bayern defeated Sevilla 2–1 after extra time, with Javi Martínez scoring the winning goal.[68] On 30 September 2020, they won the 2020 DFL-Supercup after defeating the runners-up of the Bundesliga Dortmund 3–2.[69] In February 2021, they won the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup (postponed from December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) after defeating African champions Al Ahly SC 2–0 by a brace from Robert Lewandowski, and then winning in the final against Mexican team Tigres UANL 1–0 after a goal from Benjamin Pavard and became only the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona won it in 2009.[70] Later, Bayern failed to defend its Champions League title after being knocked out by PSG in quarter-finals.[71] However, it managed to win its 9th Bundesliga title in a row.[72] During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller's record for the number of goals scored in a Bundesliga season after scoring 41 times.[73]

On 27 April 2021, Bayern announced that Flick would be leaving at the end of the season, at his request, and that RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann would become the new manager, effective 1 July.[74] According to multiple reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m, a world record for a manager, as compensation for Nagelsmann's services.[75] It was later announced that Flick was leaving to take charge of the German national team of which he had previously been the assistant coach under manager Joachim Löw.[76]",1,518,2.1,0.1,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.88,1460
41521,55,"Stade Félix Bollaert
Lens' steady progress continued, and after finishing second in the league behind Nantes, they managed to qualify to the UEFA Cup. They knocked out Swedish club Malmö FF, and more impressively, the strong Italian club Lazio. After an away defeat (2–0), they won 6–0 at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis after extra-time. Unfortunately, after this rare international exploit for a French club, they were then eliminated by East German side 1. FC Magdeburg. Worse still, the club went back to the second division in 1978.. Martel's takeover
In August 1988 Gervais Martel, a wealthy local businessman, bought control of the club, with the help of Serge Doré. During the same year, Arnaud Dos Santos was named head coach of the club, and led the club back to the first division in 1991.

In 1993 and 1994, Lens' strongest team to that date were highly competitive at the top of the league, and the team qualified for the UEFA Cup twice in a row. Lens also reached the semi-final of the Coupe de France after knocking out Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes, although the team lost to Montpellier.

In 1998, es Sang et Or wrote the best page of their history under Daniel Leclercq (""the Druid""): French champions, Coupe de la Ligue semi-finalists and finalists of the Coupe de France (against PSG, a 2–1 defeat). Like a symbol, it is a player who started his career in Lens, Yohan Lachor, who scored the goal in Auxerre giving Lens the title in front of Metz. Under the ""Druid"", Lens won its second major title in 1999 with the Coupe de la Ligue against Metz, with a goal from Daniel Moreira. That year, in the UEFA Champions League, Lens also became the only club to have beaten English team Arsenal at the famous Wembley Stadium (1–0, with a goal from Mickaël Debève), although they were knocked out on aggregate score over two matches.

During the next season, Leclercq was fired, but Lens nonetheless did well to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. François Brisson's men were eventually eliminated by Arsenal, after they won against 1. FC Kaiserslautern (a 4–1 win in Germany), Atlético Madrid and Celta de Vigo.

In the 2001–02 season, Joël Muller was named head coach. Lens finished second that season and qualified for its second Champions League campaign. The club, however, finished in eighth for the next two years. Muller was replaced during his fourth season by Francis Gillot, who managed to qualify Lens for the UEFA Intertoto Cup, which Lens won, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Cup.

During the 2006–07 season, the Sang et Or finished the first part of the season in second, behind Lyon. But due to a chaotic second half, however, they only finished fifth. A few days later, Francis Gillot resigned.

On 5 June 2007, Guy Roux made his comeback, although it only lasted three months: He resigned after a 2–1 defeat at Strasbourg. Jean-Pierre Papin took over, but Lens could not make up any ground throughout the season, finishing 18th, two points behind Toulouse, resulting in relegation to Ligue 2 for the next season. Lens finished the season with just 40 points, winning only 9 times in 38 matches.

After a slow start in their only year in Ligue 2, they managed to finish as leaders during the first half of the season. Earning 13 out of 15 points in their first five games of the second half, everything looked set for a quick return to the first league. After only taking five points of the next six games, however, the promotion race was open again, although Lens recovered and became champions, securing promotion to Ligue 1 for 2009–10. After the 2010–11 season, however, they again dropped to Ligue 2.

On 16 May 2014, Lens sealed promotion back to Ligue 1 on the final day of the season following a 2–0 win at Bastia. On 27 June, however, the League's National Directorate of Management Control (DNCG) blocked Lens' promotion to the top flight due to irregularities in the club's proposed budget for its next season. The issue was a €10 million payment due from major shareholder Hafiz Mammadov that was missing from the accounts. Lens president Gervais Martel claimed a public holiday in Mammadov's native Azerbaijan had resulted in the delay and said the club would appeal. On 15 July, however, their promotion was in jeopardy after an appeal commission upheld their appeal since the missing funds still had not yet arrived in the club's accounts. Lens immediately declared their intention to appeal to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), which has the power to overrule the DNCG. On 25 July, the CNSOF recommended Lens should be allowed to play in Ligue 1. Because the Stade Bollaert-Delelis was being renovated for UEFA Euro 2016, Lens played their home matches for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 season at the Stade de la Licorne, home of Amiens, and at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

It was announced on 29 January 2015 that Lens' promotion from Ligue 2 at the end of the 2013–14 season has been ruled invalid, and will thus be automatically relegated to Ligue 2 for the 2015–16 season, regardless of where the team places. Thus, in August 2015 Lens returned to Ligue 2, albeit playing at the renovated Stade Bollaert-Delelis. They drew an average home attendance of 28,996 in the 2016–17 season, the highest in Ligue 2 but missed promotion to the Ligue 1 during a tumultuous last day of the season.[2]",2,955,14.4,0,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.97,1460

41528,69,"Mourinho's golden years (2001–2004)

José Mourinho led Porto to consecutive UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League titles.
The appointment of former club player and assistant coach Octávio Machado to head Porto back to the league title appeared to pay off as the team began the season with a Supertaça win against the 2000–01 Primeira Liga winners, Boavista.[51] However, this would be the only major achievement in a lacklustre season that would culminate with a third place in the league classification – the lowest in 20 years. The elimination from the 2001–02 Taça de Portugal, four days after losing away for the Primeira Liga, precipitated the sacking of Machado after 36 matches in charge.[78]

Two days later, Porto signed União de Leiria's coach, José Mourinho, who had previously worked for the club alongside Robson.[79] In his presentation, Mourinho promptly showcased his personality by stating unequivocally that the club would win next season's league title.[78] He kept true to his promise and delivered one of the club's most successful seasons. Fielding the likes of Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, Maniche, and less known players hired from other Portuguese clubs, such as Paulo Ferreira, Pedro Emanuel, Nuno Valente and Derlei, Porto won the 2002–03 Primeira Liga with relative comfort, finishing 11 points ahead of second-placed Benfica.[80] The club also won the UEFA Cup, defeating Celtic in a dramatic extra-time final, to win its second major European title.[81] Mourinho then secured an unprecedented treble for Porto by winning the Taça de Portugal final against his previous club.[36]

The 2003–04 season began with another 1–0 win over União de Leiria, which gave the club its 13th Supertaça.[51] Weeks later, Porto failed to repeat this success in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup, losing 1–0 to Milan.[82] The departure of striker Hélder Postiga was compensated by the signing of South Africa's Benni McCarthy, whose 20 league goals helped Porto in its league title defense and crowned him the competition's top scorer.[83]

Porto entered the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League directly into the group stage. Porto finished second in its group, losing only once to Real Madrid, and advanced to the round-of-16 where they met Manchester United. After narrowly winning at home (2–1), Porto was on the verge of elimination, being behind by 1–0 till the last minute of official playtime at the second leg at Old Trafford. However, Porto scored the equalizer in the 90th minute of the second leg to draw 1–1 and to advance to the quarter-finals with a 3–2 aggregate win. The team then overcame Lyon and Deportivo La Coruña to reach the Champions League final. Porto defeated Monaco 3–0 to lift the club's second European Champion Clubs' Cup.[84] A 2–1 loss to Benfica in the Taça de Portugal final, held 10 days before, prevented another treble-winning season.[36]",1,499,2.9,0.1,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.97,1460
41528,70,"Life after Mourinho (2004–2010)
The successful European performances of Mourinho's Porto enhanced the reputations of the coach and players like Carvalho, Ferreira and Deco, all of whom left the club in the aftermath of the Champions League victory.[85][86][87][88] The following season was an atypical one, as the club had three coaches: Luigi Delneri,[f] Víctor Fernández and José Couceiro. Under Férnandez, Porto won the 2004 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and the 2004 Intercontinental Cup, but lost the 2004 UEFA Super Cup to Valencia and was eliminated prematurely in the 2004–05 Taça de Portugal. Recording only 17 wins in 34 matches, Porto lost the Primeira Liga title to Benfica by three points.[90] During this period, Porto was directly involved in the corruption scandal Apito Dourado.[91]

In 2005–06, Dutch coach Co Adriaanse was picked to reorganise the team and return the club to the top of Portuguese football. His tactical discipline and the contribution of new signings Lucho González and Lisandro López led the club to not only retake the Primeira Liga title but also secure its fifth domestic double, after beating holders Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal final.[92] Adriaanse's domestic success did not transfer to the Champions League, as Porto finished in the bottom of its group.[93]

The club began the 2006–07 season with a new coach, Jesualdo Ferreira, signed from neighbours Boavista. Before Ferreira assumed his role, Porto won the season-opening Supertaça, with former club player Rui Barros acting as interim coach.[94] An experienced head coach, Ferreira had never achieved major club level success, but in his first season in Porto he became national champion for the first time.[95] The 2006–07 Primeira Liga title was only secured in a frantic final day, as Porto finished one point above Sporting and two above Benfica.[96] In the following season, the club achieved the Tri for the second time in its history – with López clinching the top goalscorer award –, but lost the Taça and Supertaça finals to Sporting CP.[97] As result of a legal investigation on match fixing in Portuguese football, Porto was punished with the loss of six points, which did not affect its final league classification.[98]

Having claimed a sixth league and cup double in the 2008–09 season,[99] Porto was on course to emulate the Penta of the late 1990s, but the series was broken by Benfica in the following season.[100] Although Ferreira won his first Supertaça and defended the Taça de Portugal title, the team's failure to claim a fifth consecutive league – finishing third, outside the Champions League-qualifying places – and a 3–0 defeat against Benfica in the final of the Taça da Liga contributed to his resignation at the end of the season. A home win against Benfica prevented the rivals from celebrating the league title at the Estádio do Dragão.[100] Under Ferreira's steering, Porto always qualified for the Champions League knockout stage, reaching the quarter-finals in 2008–09, where it was eliminated by holders Manchester United.[101]",1,521,2.6,0,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.96,1460

André Villas-Boas during a press conference as Porto coach
André Villas-Boas won four trophies in one season with Porto, including the UEFA Europa League.
The arrival of Mourinho's former assistant André Villas-Boas, in the spring of 2010, set the stage for a highly successful 2010–11 season, which began with a 2–0 victory over Benfica for the Supertaça.[51] Spearheaded by João Moutinho, Silvestre Varela, Falcao and Hulk (the Bola de Prata winner), Porto performed strongly in the Primeira Liga and assured its 25th title with five matches to play, after beating Benfica in its stadium.[102] In addition, the club broke a number of records: biggest distance between champions and runners-up (21 points), the most consecutive league wins (16), and the highest percentage of points in a 30-game season (93.33%), dropping only six points and finishing the league without defeats, for the first time in its history.[103] Eight years after the 2003 triumph, Porto returned to the UEFA Cup (renamed UEFA Europa League) and reached the final in Dublin's Aviva Stadium. In an all-Portuguese affair, Porto beat Braga with a goal from the competition's top goalscorer Falcao and lifted the trophy for the second time,[104] as Villas-Boas became the youngest UEFA competition-winning coach.[105] Four days later, Porto won its third consecutive Taça de Portugal with a convincing 6–2 scoreline,[36] securing their fourth trophy of the season.[102]

As Villas-Boas left for Chelsea, Porto recruited the services of his assistant, Vítor Pereira. For the third straight year, the club began the season with another Supertaça title,[51] which was followed by a 2–0 loss to Barcelona for the 2011 UEFA Super Cup.[106] Although lacking the goalscoring prolificacy of Falcao (sold to Atlético Madrid), Porto was able to revalidate the Primeira Liga title,[107] but was eliminated prematurely from the Taça and Champions League competitions. Transferred to the Europa League, Porto failed to defend its title after being knocked out by Manchester City.[108] In the following season, the club went a stage further in both domestic cup competitions and in the Champions League, where it fell to Málaga in the last-16 round.[109] In the 2012–13 Primeira Liga, Porto reduced the distance to leaders Benfica to two points, before hosting them in the penultimate matchday. In a dramatic turn of events, Porto won with a goal in stoppage time and moved to the top of the league table.[110] An away victory in the last game confirmed the Tri and Porto's 27th league title – the second without defeats.[111]

Porto entered the 2013–14 season with a new head coach – Paulo Fonseca, signed from 2012 to 2013 Primeira Liga third-placed Paços de Ferreira[112] – but continued the trend of the previous four seasons by winning the Supertaça.[51] This title would be the highlight of the season, as the club underperformed in every other competition it was involved. In the league, Porto led with five points over its pursuers, but a series of compromising results pushed the club down to third place, resulting in the sacking of Fonseca.[113] Failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, Porto reached the Europa League quarter-finals, where they lost 4–1 to the eventual winners Sevilla.[114] In the following weeks, two semi-final losses against Benfica closed the doors to the finals of the Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga, the latter at home on penalties.[36][115]

Porto started the 2014–15 season with their biggest budget ever,[116] hiring Spanish head coach Julen Lopetegui. Despite the signing of many new players, they failed to win any silverware, contributing to the biggest hiatus during Pinto da Costa's presidency.[117] They also equalized, in terms of goals conceded, their biggest defeat in European competitions (6–1 against AEK Athens) and suffered their biggest defeat in the UEFA Champions League (6–1 against Bayern Munich, after the 5–0 loss against Arsenal in 2010).[118][119] Porto continued their losing trend in the 2015–16 season, making it the second consecutive trophyless season, with the contribution of José Peseiro, who had replaced Julen Lopetegui in January 2016. After the season was over, Peseiro was replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo.",1,732,2.7,0.1,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.95,1460
41528,72,"Conceição era (2017–present)
In the 2017–18 season, after almost five years without winning any trophy, Porto won their 28th league title with the contribution of coach Sérgio Conceição (former club player).[120] The following year, in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, Porto managed to reach the quarter-finals of the competition, but were defeated by 6–1 on aggregate against the eventual winners Liverpool.[121]

In the 2019–20 season, Porto managed to recapture the league title, winning it for the 29th time and added for the first time in eleven years the Portuguese cup along with it. However, despite their national success, FC Porto did not reach the group phase of the Champions League and did poorly in their Europa League campaign.

In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16, Porto won on away goals rule (4–4 on aggregate) against Juventus, to reach the quarter-finals.[122] The season would, however, end with only one national trophy, the Supertaça.

After having lost the national title to Sporting in the previous season, Porto's 2021–22 season saw them reach various successes at domestic level: with Conceição at the helm for the 5th season in a row, the team recaptured the Primeira Liga, achieving a record 91 points. During the season, the Dragons also set a new record for longest unbeaten run in the league, with 58 matches, a sequence that had been started during the first half of the 2020–21 edition. One week after the league's conclusion, they added the domestic cup, thus securing the second double in Conceição's reign.",1,270,3.1,0.2,"/Sports/Team Sports/Soccer",0.88,1460

46554,69,"Lens protocol introduction. Source: Lens protocol
In the lens system, there are two concepts called 'crypto wallet' and 'profile'. In rough outlines, it is possible to define a crypto wallet as a 'user' and a profile as a 'content creator'. Let's talk about the crypto wallet first:",1,48,0.1,0,NA,NA,1460
46554,74,"On top of these features we are familiar with from Twitter, Lens adds two important innovations brought by Web3: First, the profile we are talking about is actually an NFT. This profile NFT owns all content (i.e. posts, comments to other posts or retweets) created by the profile. The owner of the crypto wallet also owns this NFT. He can keep more than one profile (ie NFT) in his wallet and can transfer this profile to someone else if he wishes.",1,82,1,0,"/Online Communities",0.68,1460
46554,76,"The second is the 'follow NFT' given to followers. If any user wants to follow a profile, they can do so with the NFT given by the profile. The profile owner can set certain rules for these tracking NFTs; such as paying a certain fee per content.",1,47,0.6,0,"/Arts & Entertainment",0.51,1460

46554,81,"What does 'to have the full connection' mean? Crypto wallet owners know this all too well. One of the most important features of cryptocurrencies is that one can fully own their existence.. A similar situation will be in question for social networks thanks to Web3. Any content you share on Facebook or Twitter, currently called Web2, is not actually yours. The sole owner of all of them is the platform. If you were the owner, you could take the content you created and take it to another platform. Likewise, the tens of hundreds of followers you have do not belong to you. If you don't believe it, ask the big US President Donald Trump. Sorry, you can't ask, because the account with 89 million followers was suddenly shut down in January 2021.

Thrillers
Real zombies! Okay, not exactly. But A Nightmare on Elm Street director Wes Craven did base his movie – very, very loosely – on a book of the same name by anthropologist Wade Davis, which recounted his experiences investigating voodoo cults in Haiti. The film’s a fair bit sillier, as Bill Pullman’s anthropologist discovers the truth behind the zombie mythos. It’s a lot of fun, though.",1,75,1.5,0.1,"/Arts & Entertainment/Movies",0.76,1460

Film
Animation
This kid-friendly zombie flick from award-winning Oregon animation house Laika goes light on gore and big on heart and plenty of references to much more adult films. An outcast at school, thanks to his electro-shock hairdo and love of all things horror, young Norman Babcock’s ability to convene with spirits makes him the only hope for saving his hometown from a witch’s curse that causes the dead to rise. It’s a supernatural caper not far removed from an old Scooby-Doo episode, and an excellent gateway into the zombie genre for little horror fiends.. White Zombie (1932)
Film
Horror
Not just the inspiration for a metal band, this eerie oddity is generally considered to be the very first zombie film – and boy, did they do things differently in those days. Forget all that groaning, flesh-eating and actually being dead. This features a Haitian voodoo priest – played, naturally, by Béla Lugosi – who drugs his victims and turns them into zombie slaves.. Zombieland (2009)
Film
Comedy
Sure, zombie movies may be filled with guts and gore and people getting ripped, graphically, in two. But there’s something about those goofy, shuffling bastards that’s just inherently comical. This action comedy set in a post-apocalyptic America is hardly original, but it breezes by on charm, aided by arguably the starriest cast ever assembled for a zom-com – Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and a very dead Bill Murray.. The Plague of the Zombies (1966)
Film
Horror
It was only made two years before Night of the Living Dead, but this likeable Hammer Studios effort could’ve come from a different century. In a cosy little nineteenth-century Cornish village, mysterious happenings are afoot. It soon transpires that the local laird has been creating undead slaves to work in his tin mine, which is a novel approach to labour laws if nothing else.",5,325,6.5,0.1,"/Arts & Entertainment/Movies",0.89,1460

- I literally named the function `initOwnershipTransfer` at the beggining! But then I decided to keep the `transferOwnership` name as maybe part of the process can be done without needing to rewrite scripts or integrations. But I can agree with the renaming for sure.

- The same point was made by frangio from OpenZeppelin. I personally disagree, I think is hard to choose a proper timelock; too short could be equivalent to not having it, too long is annoying if you need a quick transfer.

2) I legit have never been on such a great team before! How the team moves so fast, it's incredible. Plus, I truly enjoy myself every time I'm working with the team 🔥🔥🔥. GM!
1) I am smart contract developer doing full stack development. I am in Blockchain and Grant Team.
2) I love the team because everyone is on the top of their game and everyone is super helpful. We work super hard and believer of Eden Vision.. Gm!
1) I am a full stack developer, contributing to Frontend at Eden🌳. My goal is to develop Eden UI as user Centric as possible.
2) I love the Team because everyone is super helpful and ready to guide you. Their enthusiasm for the Idea is really motivating. The way everyone is so interactive makes working at Eden so much fun.. LFG! So happy to be part of this project. 1) I am a blockchain Dev at Eden but I jump around a bit so I am not restricted to Blockchain.
2) I love the Team because everyone is so welcoming, you can ask questions about the things you don't understand to anybody and learn from such incredible people.. gm!

1) I'm a designer, contributing to the UX/UI of Eden 🌳 trying to make the experience as seamless as possible for the users!

3) What really attracts me about the project are the people behind, buidling it. Their energy and optimism are what keeps me motivated and always up for taking on new challenges!
And obviously, huge props to @impactbilli.lens & @bluepanda.lens for managing everything so good! couldn't have been possible without them.. gm!!

1) I am the product lead for Eden 🌳 - I essentially try to come up with answers to the question: what should(n't) we build & why? 

2) What I love about the team is that we're the product of what web3 is all about: community & (self-sovereign) purpose. It feels like we're able to build in ways that are completely new (to me at least) - for example having been able to ship an alpha in less than 1,5 months in D_D with a team of 30 people that 1.5 months ago were strangers on the internet and now I crack jokes w on the daily. Or that we have access to all of our potential users with just a discord message away. Can't wait to see what the future holds for team Eden 🌳.. heeey guys

1) I am the tech lead of Eden 🌳  focusing on coordinating the technical team 
2) Loooooove the people that Eden attracts, right now we are closing on 30 permanent contributors, and every one of them ar incredible. I am just inspired and excited",8,478,19.4,0.5,"/Online Communities",0.59,1460

TY for this article, Regan! We need to have more conversations around the ngmi impact of lack of DEIBA in web3. Unfortunately, the future is pretty much web2 + web3 so the same power players in the toxic bro culture exist in web3.

@womeninweb3.lens is a community and DAO-2B I founded March of 2021. We have a similar vision to the women cohort Launch House launched - our goal is to inspire and elevate women entrepreneurs in web3...except we are a team of women that come from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and we live and breathe DEIBA.

Another way to ensure that women are at the forefront of web3, building with male, LGBTQIA2S+ allies, is to fund our Gitcoin GR15 Grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/6271/women-in-web3-venture-builder.

As well as other incredible DEI Grants for women: https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?page=2&limit=12&me=false&sort_option=&collection_id=false&network=mainnet&state=active&profile=false&round_num=0&customer_name=false&sub_round_slug=false&collections_page=1&grant_regions=&grant_types=&grant_tags=*Diversity+%28DEI%29&tenants=&idle=false&featured=true&round_type=false&tab=grants&keyword=Women+in+Web3. cool. like.

“Homework” by Jack Prelutsky

Homework! Oh, Homework!

I hate you! You stink!

I wish I could wash you away in the sink,

if only a bomb

would explode you to bits.

Homework! Oh, homework!

You're giving me fits.

I'd rather take baths

with a man-eating shark,

or wrestle a lion

alone in the dark,

eat spinach and liver,

pet ten porcupines,

than tackle the homework,

my teacher assigns.

Homework! Oh, homework!

you're last on my list,

I simple can't see

why you even exist,

if you just disappeared

it would tickle me pink.

Homework! Oh, homework!

I hate you! You stink!",3,143,16.7,0,NA,NA,1460
